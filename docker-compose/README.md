# Docker and Docker-compose

Before start make sure you installed docker and docker-compose on your PC.
In this I added docker-compose, Dockerfile, and env files for quick setup.

### Basic Run Command

```sh
$ docker-compose -d up
$ docker-compose logs
$ docker-compose down
$ docker-compose rm
```
